- A set is a data structure that can hold a collection of values. The values however must be unique.

- Set can contain a mix of different data types.
You can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same set.

- Sets are dynamically sized.

- Sets do not maintain an insertion order.

- Sets are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop.

## Set Vs Arary

- Array can contain duplicate values whereas sets can not.

- Insertion order is maintained in arrays but it is not the case with sets.

- Searching and deleting an element in the set is faster comapred to arrays.
