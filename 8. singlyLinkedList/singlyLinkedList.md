# Singly Linked List

- A linked list is a linear DS that includes a series of connected nodes.

- Each node consists of a data, value and a pointer that points to the next node.

- The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure.

- Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity.


## It supports three main operations:

- (a) Insertion :- To add an element at the beginning, end or at the given index in the list.

- (b) Deletion :- To remove an element given it's index or value.

- (c) Search :- To find an element given it's value.


## Linked List Usage

- All applications of both stacks and queues are applications of linked lists.
